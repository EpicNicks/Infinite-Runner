# Infinite-Runner
For android platforms
A game I made for fun to toy with random spawning.

How to Install
------------------
1. Copy the APK onto your phone
2. Go to the file on your phone and Install it. You may receive a warning as it is an APK file that did not originate from the Play store. Ignore that and keep going.

How to play
------------------
1. Press and release the screen to jump
2. The amount of time you keep your finger held down will affect the height of your jump. (Quick tap = short jump).
3. Collect coins to buy upgrades in the shop (to be further added to)
